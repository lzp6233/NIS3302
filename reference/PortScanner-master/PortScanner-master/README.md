# PortScanner
Developed a port scanner for scanning types such as UDP, SYN, ACK, NULL, FIN, and XMAS using C++ and raw sockets. 
Connected scanner to ports using TCP or UDP sockets and determined whether ports were open or closed based on responses to IP addresses.
Enabled the scanner to verify ports were running expected services such as SSH, HTTP, SMTP, and more.
